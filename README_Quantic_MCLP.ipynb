    "\n",
    "In this article, we present the process and results of using quantum computing (QC) to solve the maximal covering location problem proposed by Church and ReVelle. With this contribution, we seek to lay the foundations for other urban and regional scientists to begin to consider quantum technologies. We obtained promising results, but it is clear that there is a need for more capable devices with more qubits and less susceptibility to electronic noise to solve instances that currently cannot be optimally solved by traditional solvers. We foresee that QC will be of common use in urban and regional science and its applications in the years to come."
